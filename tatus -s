    Implement improved NaN handling and standardize stage names
    
    üîß NaN Handling Improvements:
    - Added user-friendly 'no results' message when all values are NaN
    - Shows informative message: 'The report returned no results with current filters'
    - Provides helpful suggestions for users (adjust filters, select different columns)
    - Added note when some categories have no data (shown as zero)
    - Implemented for both grouped and non-grouped bar charts
    
    üìã Stage Name Standardization:
    - Updated controlled test data to use 'Closed - WON' and 'Closed - LOST'
    - Fixed all test assertions to match standardized stage names
    - Enhanced feature engine to support multiple stage naming conventions
    - Maintained backward compatibility with 'Won'/'Lost' variants
    
    ‚úÖ Verified Functionality:
    - All existing tests pass (20/20 core tests)
    - days_to_close_won feature works correctly with proper stage names
    - Bar charts show meaningful messages instead of 'Government: nan'
    - Grouping by Owner/Business Unit works properly
    - Both individual NaN categories and all-NaN cases handled gracefully

    - Maintains technical names internally for data processing
    
    EXAMPLES OF TRANSFORMATIONS:
    - 'SellPrice' ‚Üí 'Sell Price'
    - 'BusinessUnit' ‚Üí 'Business Unit'
    - 'DaysInPipeline' ‚Üí 'Days In Pipeline'
    - 'OpportunityName' ‚Üí 'Opportunity Name'
    - 'Sum of SellPrice' ‚Üí 'Total Sell Price'
    - 'Mean of DaysInPipeline' ‚Üí 'Average Days In Pipeline'
    - 'UserWinRate' ‚Üí 'User Win Rate'
    
    TECHNICAL FEATURES:
    - Regex-based camelCase splitting with intelligent handling
    - Sequence detection for abbreviations (ID, API, CRM, etc.)
    - Aggregation pattern recognition and replacement
    - Chart title mapping with context awareness
    - Backwards compatibility with all existing functionality
    
    BUSINESS IMPACT:
    - Professional appearance suitable for executive presentations
    - Improved user experience for business stakeholders
    - Reduced learning curve for non-technical users

    Add comprehensive sorting options to all reports for improved data analysis
    
    NEW FEATURE: Report Sorting Controls
    
    Problem: Charts and tables displayed data in arbitrary order, making it difficult
    to identify patterns, find top/bottom performers, or analyze data systematically.
    
    Solution: Comprehensive sorting options for all relevant report types.
    
    Features by Report Type:
    
    BAR CHARTS:
    - Sort by Category Name (A-Z alphabetical)
    - Sort by Value (Low to High / High to Low)
    - Original Order (unsorted)
    - Works with both simple and grouped bar charts
    - Clear visual indicators in chart titles
    
    BOX PLOTS:
    - Sort by Category Name (A-Z alphabetical)
    - Sort by Median Value (Low to High / High to Low)
    - Original Order (unsorted)
    - Calculates median for each category to enable value-based sorting
    - Maintains statistical accuracy while improving readability
    
    DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:
    - Sort by Column Name (A-Z alphabetical)
    - Sort by Data Type (groups similar column types)
    - Sort by Record Count (High to Low - find most complete data)
    - Sort by Missing Data (Low to High - find cleanest data)
    - Original Order (unsorted)
    - Handles formatted numbers (removes commas for proper numeric sorting)
    
    UI Improvements:
    - Dedicated 'Sorting Options' sections with clear labels
    - Intuitive option names with directional arrows (‚Üë/‚Üì)
    - Helpful tooltips explaining each sorting method
    - Default to 'Original Order' to preserve existing behavior
    - Smart formatting that handles comma-separated numbers
    
    Chart Enhancements:
    - Sorting method clearly indicated in chart titles
    - Consistent color schemes maintained after sorting

    - Visual arrows show sort direction (‚Üë ascending, ‚Üì descending)
    
    Business Value:
    - Quickly identify top/bottom performing categories
    - Spot data quality issues (missing data, incomplete records)
    - Compare categories systematically rather than randomly
    - Professional presentation with logical data ordering
    - Better insights through organized data visualization

    Add upper limit feature for histogram charts to handle skewed distributions
    
    NEW FEATURE: Histogram Upper Limit Grouping
    
    Problem: Highly skewed distributions make histograms hard to read, with most data
    compressed into a few bins while outliers create many sparse bins.
    
    Solution: Optional upper limit that groups all values above a threshold into a single bin.
    
    Features:
    - Checkbox to enable/disable upper limit functionality
    - Automatic calculation of 95th and 99th percentiles as suggested limits
    - Configurable upper limit value with data-driven min/max bounds
    - Customizable label for the upper limit bin (default: '>= [value]')
    - Clear indication in chart title showing how many values were grouped
    - Visual annotation explaining the grouping behavior
    - Works with both simple and grouped histograms
    - Uses deduplicated data to avoid double-counting opportunities
    
    UI Improvements:
    - Real-time display of percentile metrics to help choose appropriate limits
    - Smart default to 95th percentile (good for most skewed distributions)
    - Flexible step size based on data range
    - Only available for numerical columns (with appropriate messaging)
    
    Example: Sales amount histogram with upper limit of  groups all deals
    above  into a single bin, making the main distribution clearly visible.
    
    Perfect for: Deal sizes, pipeline values, time periods, or any skewed numerical data.
